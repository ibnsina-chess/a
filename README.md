# Chess Club Admin Website

This project is a web-based admin system for managing a chess club's membership. It provides an interface for adding, viewing, and managing member information, as well as a styled layout for the user interface.

## Features

- **Homepage** (`index.html`): Acts as the main dashboard for the admin system.
- **Add Member Page** (`addMember.html`): Allows admins to add new members to the club.
- **Member Details Page** (`member.html`): Displays detailed information about an individual member.
- **Members List Page** (`members.html`): Lists all the members of the chess club in a structured format.
- **Custom Styles**: A `style.css` file provides consistent and visually appealing styling across all pages.
